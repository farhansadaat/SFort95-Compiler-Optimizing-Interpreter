# SFort95-Compiler-Optimizing-Interpreter
Built an optimizing compiler front-end and interpreter for a Fortran-like language in C++. Implemented lexical analysis, recursive-descent parsing, AST construction, constant-folding optimization, and runtime execution using a symbol table, demonstrating strong foundations in compiler design and systems programming.
